# Library-Management-System

The Library Management System is a Python-based command-line application that allows users to manage a library of books. It provides various functionalities such as loading book data, adding and removing books, searching for books based on different criteria, getting all categories for a book title, sorting books, and quitting the program.

## Features

~ Load Data: The system allows users to load book data from a file. The supported file format and structure are specified in the 'T102_P5_load_data.py' file.

~ Add and Remove Books: Users can add new books to the library by providing details such as title, author, language, publisher, rating, pages, and category. They can also remove books from the library based on the title and category.

~ Search Books: Users can search for books in the library using various criteria, including title, rating, author, publisher, and category. The system provides functions to retrieve books that match the specified criteria.

~ Get All Categories for Book Title: Users can retrieve all the categories associated with a given book title.

~ Sort Books: The system allows users to sort the books in the library based on different attributes such as title, rating, publisher, and author. Sorting can be done in ascending or descending order.
